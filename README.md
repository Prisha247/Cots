# Cots
**NerdHerd Team 687, Cots 2013 build season robot**  
**Recreated 2017, Command based code**

**General Discrption:** Cots is an agile robot, designed for speed and 
high durability. Cots runs on a four wheel drive base system and has
a shooter with vertical translative movement. The robot can hold up 
to 4 frisbees that can shoot at high speeds, distance and accuracy.

**Programming:** Cots currently only runs on a tank drive system. 
However, updates are soon to include arcade drive and other 
drive options. The shooting system shoots frisbees by manual
loading, then with joystick control, the flywheels turn on and
pushes the frisbee into the flywheels and retracts. Another button
stops the flywheel movement.
